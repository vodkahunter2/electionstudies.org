# Assignment Overview

## Background

The American healthcare system has undergone significant policy discussions and reform attempts over the past several years. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), initially implemented in 2010, continued to be a major point of political contention during the 2016 and 2020 election cycles. Meanwhile, the COVID-19 pandemic that emerged in 2020 placed unprecedented stress on the healthcare system and potentially altered public attitudes toward healthcare policy.

This assignment leverages the American National Election Studies (ANES) 2016-2020 panel data to examine how individual attitudes toward healthcare policies changed over this crucial four-year period. The panel structure of the data allows us to track the same individuals over time, enabling more rigorous analysis of causal factors in attitude change.

## Objectives

In this assignment, you will:

1. Analyze changes in healthcare attitudes between 2016 and 2020 at the individual level
2. Develop and test regression models with lagged variables to examine the determinants of healthcare opinion change
3. Properly handle panel data and implement appropriate standard errors
4. Interpret your findings in the context of political and policy developments

## Data Source

This assignment uses the American National Election Studies (ANES) 2016-2020 Panel Study, as detailed in "Kopi av ANES-2016-2020.pdf". The ANES has conducted nationally representative surveys of the American electorate since 1948, with the panel study specifically following the same respondents across the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections.

# Assignment Tasks

## Task 1: Data Preparation and Exploration (20 points)

1. Load and prepare the ANES 2016-2020 panel data for analysis
2. Identify and select relevant healthcare variables from both 2016 and 2020
3. Create properly coded panel variables that track the same concepts across both years
4. Generate descriptive statistics for key healthcare variables
5. Create visualizations showing the distribution of healthcare attitudes in 2016 and 2020

## Task 2: Panel Analysis with Lagged Variables (30 points)

1. Construct a panel data framework for the ANES data
2. Develop regression models using lagged variables to examine how previous healthcare attitudes (2016) influence current attitudes (2020)
3. Include appropriate control variables (demographic factors, political variables)
4. Implement the correct model specification for panel data analysis
5. Interpret the coefficient on the lagged dependent variable and explain its substantive meaning

## Task 3: Standard Error Estimation (20 points)

1. Explain why standard errors might be problematic in panel data analysis
2. Implement robust standard errors in your regression models
3. Compare results with and without robust standard error estimation
4. Discuss how the choice of standard error estimation affects your substantive conclusions

## Task 4: Subgroup Analysis (15 points)

1. Examine whether healthcare attitude changes differ systematically across:
   - Partisan identification
   - Demographic categories (age, race, gender)
   - Socioeconomic factors (education, income)
2. Test for significant interactions between these factors and time
3. Visualize these differential changes with appropriate plots

## Task 5: Interpretation and Discussion (15 points)

1. Summarize your key findings about changes in healthcare attitudes from 2016 to 2020
2. Discuss potential explanations for observed changes, considering political events and the COVID-19 pandemic
3. Evaluate the strengths and limitations of your analytical approach
4. Suggest potential policy implications of your findings

# Deliverables

Your submission should include:

1. An R script implementing all analyses (with clear comments)
2. A report (PDF format, 8-10 pages) presenting your findings with appropriate tables and figures
3. Answers to all questions in the assignment tasks

# Grading Criteria

- Correctness of data preparation and analytical approach (30%)
- Proper implementation of regression models with lagged variables (25%)
- Appropriate handling of standard errors (15%)
- Quality of data visualization and presentation (15%)
- Depth of interpretation and discussion (15%)

# R Code Template

A template R script (`healthcare_panel_analysis.R`) has been provided to help you get started. You will need to modify this code to complete the assignment tasks. 

The code includes:
- Data preparation steps
- Example models with lagged variables
- Implementation of robust standard errors
- Visualization templates

# Tips for Success

- Pay careful attention to the panel structure of the data
- Be mindful of missing data and attrition between waves
- Consider how the COVID-19 pandemic might have influenced healthcare attitudes in 2020
- Remember that the coefficient on a lagged dependent variable represents persistence in attitudes
- Focus on substantive interpretation, not just statistical significance
